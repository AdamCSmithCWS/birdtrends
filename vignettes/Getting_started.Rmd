The birdtrends package enables users to estimate trends of populations into the future based on a variety of input data types. 

# Getting set-up 

1) Download birdtrends
2) Set up modelling connections. 


In order to run all of the model options, you will need to install and set up packages to enable models to be run using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). 

You can find a set of excellent installation instructions in the bbsBayes package [here](https://bbsbayes.github.io/bbsBayes2/articles/bbsBayes2.html).
