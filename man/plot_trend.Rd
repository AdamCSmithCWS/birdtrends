\usage{
plot_trend(
  raw_indices = NULL,
  model_indices = fitted_data,
  pred_indices = preds_sm,
  start_yr = 2014,
  end_yr = 2022,
  ref_yr = 2014,
  targets = NULL,
  set_upperlimit = TRUE,
  upperlimit = 1.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_indices}{tibble with raw annual index value of observed data columns = year, index, index_q_0.25 = 2.5\% confidence interval and index_q_0.975 = 97.5 \% confidence interval. If raw indices are unavavilable these will be generated based on 5 and 95 percent range}

\item{model_indices}{tibble of estimated indices drawn from fit_* function. Columns are draw, year, and proj_y}

\item{pred_indices}{datatable with modeled and predicted values into the future}

\item{start_yr}{numeric value of the first year in which trend will be calculated. Default is first available year within the dataset}

\item{end_yr}{numeric value representing the last year in which trend will be calculated. Default is first available year within the dataset}

\item{ref_yr}{numeric value representing the reference year in which trends are compared to, default is 2014 for pif calculations}

\item{targets}{optional tibble of short and term targets generated by get_targets()}

\item{set_upperlimit}{logical default is TRUE. Should the upper limit of the plot be restricted to some function of the range of the original data (only relevant when projections are strongly positive)}

\item{upperlimit}{numeric default is 1.5, The factor increase above the highest upper credible limit of the annual values of either the raw_indices or model_indices}
