\usage{
fit_smooths(indata, start_yr = NA, end_yr = NA, longform = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{indata}{dataframe of generated smooths. Each column is a year, each row is a predicted smooth}

\item{start_yr}{numeric year at which to start, if subset is required. Default is the last year available}

\item{end_yr}{numeric year at which to end, if subset is required. Default is the last year available}

\item{longform}{TRUE/FALSE the output will be converted to a longform tibble with columns draw, year, proj_y. Default = TRUE}
}
\value{
dataframe with smooths generated for each year of the selected range
