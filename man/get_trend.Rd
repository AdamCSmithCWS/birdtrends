\title{Generate trend based based on multiple draws of annual indices}
\usage{
get_trend(
  proj_data,
  start_yr = NA,
  end_yr = NA,
  method = "gmean",
  annual_variation = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{proj_data}{tibble of estimated indices drawn from fit_* function. Columns are draw, year, and proj_y}

\item{start_yr}{numeric value of the first year in which trend will be calculated. Default is first available year within the dataset}

\item{end_yr}{numeric value representing the last year in which trend will be calculated. Default is first available year within the dataset}

\item{method}{character of method used to calculate trend. Two methods available; geometric mean ("gmean" as default )or "lm" linear regression}

\item{annual_variation}{logical Estimate trends that capture some of the annual variation in rate of change. If FALSE (default), then trends are estimated for a single time-period (start_yr : end_yr), if TRUE, then trends are estimated for all possible 1-yr intervals for the selected time period. For example, if start_yr = 2012 and end_yr = 2022, then there will be 10 sets of annual trends estimated (2012:2013, 2013:2014, etc.)}
}
\value{
tibble with estimated trend and percent_trend for each draw
